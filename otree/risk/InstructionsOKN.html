<p>
    You will next choose one more lottery for ANOTHER PARTICIPANT! 
</p>

<p>
    Everything is as before&mdash;with one exception we tell you about on the next page. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A computer will flip a (different) virtual coin, where both sides are equally likely.
    </li>
    <li>
        You choose from a list of lotteries.
    </li>
    <li>
        The OTHER PARTICIPANT will get the payoff associated with the side that comes up.
    </li>
    <li>
        The OTHER PARTICIPANT is also recruited on Prolific, knows that someone else is choosing a lottery for them from the list above, but does not know that it is you specifically choosing it.
    </li>
</ul>

            Both sides are again equally likely to come up. 
        </p>

        <p>
            On the next page, we ask you to choose from lotteries that differ in their payoffs for each side of the coin---as before. The lotteries available are:
        </p>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <table id="lotteryTable" class="table">
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Lottery</th>
                                <th>Payoff for "Low"</th>
                                <th>Payoff for "High"</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <!-- Table body will be populated dynamically with JavaScript -->
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            For example, if you choose LOTTERY A, the OTHER PARTICIPANT’s payoff will be $28 regardless of which side of the coin comes up. And if you choose LOTTERY F, the OTHER PARTICIPANT’s payoff will be $2 if side "LOW" comes up and $70 if side "HIGH" comes up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, we will tell you at the end of the study whether one of your decisions is implemented and, if so, which one. If DECISION 3 is implemented, we will pay the OTHER PARTICIPANT the payoff associated with the outcome of the lottery as a bonus. So choose wisely!

                We recruited them on Prolific, just like you.

            <li>
                They do not know that you specifically are choosing it.
