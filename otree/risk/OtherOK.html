<p>
What do you need to know about the OTHER PARTICIPANT? 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
We recruited them on Prolific, just like you.</li>
<li>They know that someone else is choosing a lottery for them from the list above. </li>
<li>They do not know that you specifically are choosing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
IMPORTANTLY: If DECISION 2 is implemented, we WILL TELL YOU whether the coin came up “HIGH” or “LOW.” Thus, you WILL LEARN the OTHER PARTICIPANT’s payoff. 
</p>

<p>
This is important, so let us repeat it: 
</p>
<p class="text-center">
If DECISION 2 is implemented, you WILL LEARN the OTHER PARTICIPANT’s payoff. 
</p>
<p>
We will next ask you some questions to make sure you understand the instructions. You must answer these questions correctly before continuing.
